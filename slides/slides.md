# Big Question:
## Do we need Ops for serverless applications?

---

# Answer: Most definitely!

---

# [fit] but why?

---

# Increased abstraction = less visibility

* We can't see much by default
* If something goes wrong, how do we know what?
* Can we even tell if something's "wrong?"

---

# So with serverless, sometimes problems sneak up on us

---

# And we don't always know how to triage or debug these problems

# What do we want to observe?

* Platform health
* Code health
* Architecture health

---

# Platform Health

* Cold Starts
* CPU
* Memory
* $$$

---

# Code Health

* Runtime
* CPU/Memory Usage
* Errors

---

# Architecture Health

* Calls to outside services
* Time spent blocked
* Uptime/Downtime

---

# How do we want to observe it

* Visualizations
* Alerting
* Differentials/Summaries

---

# Visualizations

* Because you can only learn so much from logs
* Easy to read
* Ability to drill down

---

# Alerts

* Because we want to know when something's wrong!
* Alerting on several metrics if possible that cover all three categories
